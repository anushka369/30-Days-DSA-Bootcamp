## Problem Statement

In the Fruitful Forest, there is a grid of trees bearing the most delicious sweet fruits.
These trees are arranged neatly in rows, and each row is carefully enclosed by a wire fence.
The entrance to the forest is located at the top-left corner, and it's the only way to enter. 
To move deeper into the forest, one must follow a strict path:

- From the entrance, you must begin at the first tree in the top-left corner and travel to the end of the first row in right direction.
- Once you reach the end of the row, you must move down to the second row and continue your journey in left direction.
- This process repeats for every row in the forest, following a zig-zag pattern: top-left -> right-end -> down to second row -> left-end -> down to 3rd row and so on...
- As you move through the grid, you need to check the number of fruits on each tree.
  - If the number of fruits on a tree is a prime number, you must skip that tree and continue your journey, as those fruits are cursed.
  - Only the trees with non-prime numbers of fruits are worth stopping for and collecting.

After completing the collection, print the list of non-prime numbers of fruits you encounter. If all numbers encountered are prime, print -1 to indicate that no non-prime fruits were found.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two space separated integers M and N representing the number of rows and columns of the forest grid, repectively.
- The next M lines contain N space separated integers each, representing the number of fruits on each tree in the forest grid.

## Output Format

Print the non-prime numbers of fruits encountered during the zigzag traversal, separated by spaces. If no non-prime numbers are found, output -1.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ M, N ≤ 50
- 1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 10^4

## Sample Testcase 0

### Testcase Input

2 2 <br>
2 3 <br>
5 7

### Testcase Output
-1

### Explanation

2* -> 3* -> 7* -> 5* ('*' means discard) <br>
All numbers are prime, so the output is -1.

## Sample Testcase 1

### Testcase Input

3 3 <br>
4 5 6 <br>
7 8 9 <br>
10 11 12

### Testcase Output
4 6 9 8 10 12

### Explanation

Traverse the forest in a zigzag pattern as specified, excluding prime numbers: 5, 7, 11
<br> 4 -> 5* -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7* -> 10 -> 11* -> 12 ('*' means discard)
<br> The tree with non-prime numbers of fruits are: 4, 6, 9, 8, 10, 12.
