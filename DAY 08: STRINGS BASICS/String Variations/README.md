## Problem Statement

You are given a string with alphabets. You need to convert the string to lowercase and check if the string is a palindromic one. If the string is a palindrome, 
print the length of the palindromic string. If that string is a non-palindromic one, print the ASCII value of the first character of the alphabet in the given string.

## Input Format
The input consists of a single string containing only alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase).

## Output Format
Print the Length of the palindromic string if it is a palindrome after performing the above operations. Else print the ASCII value of the first character.

## Constraints
1 <= S <= 2 * (10^5)

## Sample Testcase 0

### Testcase Input
ABABABA

### Testcase Output
7

### Explanation
Since the above string is a palindrome, the length is printed.

## Sample Testcase 1

### Testcase Input
AJDHHAKOEIE

### Testcase Output
65

### Explanation
Since the above string is not a palindrome, an ASCII value of A is printed, i.e., 65.
